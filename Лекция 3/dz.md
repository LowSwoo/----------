# About myself


Let my introduce myself. My name is Nickolay. I work in Russian federal nuclear center in the department #08. 
I was born in the town of Schekino, Tula region, it was 23 years ago. My family consists of me, grandmother and sister. 
My father was flaw detector. He has inspected gas pipelines across the country for defects using various non-destructive testing methods. For example, ultrasound.
My mother is the chief accountant in the Shchekino city administration. 
I'll tell you about my sister later.
In 2006 year I went to study at the Gymnasium, and 5 years later, I entered Physics and Mathematics Lyceum.
After school I perferred to get a higher education than join the ranks of the army. 


In 2017 year the fate determinated my future institute. It became Sarov Physics And Techology Institute. I got to the department of Radiophysics and Electronics because this area of training interests me. In February 2023, my learning came to an end. 


Since 2014 I became interested in software development. My fatherâ€™s friend, who at that time had been working as a programmer in the Czech Republic for a long time, helped me with this. He told me to start with the C++ programming language. I have tried a large number of programming languages and development directions since then moment. My choice was to develop software for the UNIX system. 
When I was in my first year, the teacher invited me to practice at #0829 department. And now I work under his leadership. We are develop an operating system for supercomputers. 


I promised to tell you about my sister. Well... She is 6 years younger than me, a teenager of 17 years old. Maria takes after me. Just like me, she first studied at gymnasium, then she studied at physics and mathematics lyceum. Now she is in 11th grade and plans to enter the same institute as me.
