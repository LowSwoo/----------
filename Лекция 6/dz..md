Let me introduce myself. My name is Nickolay Zheltikoov, I work in Russian Federal Nuclear Center in the department number 08

I graduated from Sarov Institute of Physics and Techics in February 2023, I studied at the department of Radiophysics and Electronics.
I enjoyed my five and half years in institute, because our group was very friendly. 

After my graduation, I decided to take a post-graduate course to increase my knowledge in technical fields.
And now i'm a firsst year post-graduate student of All-Russian Research institute of Experimental Physics. 


My research deals with system Programming the Theme if dissertation is 
"Implementation of support for mandatory access control of a protected operating system "Aramid" in containerization tools".
Now I'm collecting information about virtalization systems and access control systems.

I work in close contact with my research adviser, Kurulin Vadim Victorovich.
If i Have difficulties in research, i can turn to him for help.

These days, developers are trying to make their applications isolated from the external environment,
but existing mandatory access control tools do not allow setting access rights for containers. When working with protected data,
it is necessary to limit user access to different privacy levels.
This is the reason for the choice of my qualifying work.

Currently I am working on related issues, for example, developing an extension that will allow making requests via the HTTP protocol for the Slurm Workload Manager.

I have just started my research. And I hope to complete my work by the 2025 year.
