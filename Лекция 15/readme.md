The article under consideration is entitled "Making Light of Silicon". The author of the text is Steven Ashley, Scientific American by 2009. The paper presents silicon lasers and making light of silicon. The usage of silicon later in incroporate both electrionic and optical devices onto cheap silicon chips rather than being compelled to employ costly-to-make lasers based on "exotic" semiconductor materials such as gellium arsenide or indium phosphide.

Two research group are busy at that problem: one at the University of california at Los Angeles and the other at Intel Corporation.
First group, UCLA Team focused on the Raman Effect and matched the scattered light with pump energy from another laser.

The second team, Intel Corporation fed light from a separate laser  onto 150milimetersquare silicon chip, which was into a S-shaped waweguide and gor Raman-laser light.
The main problem was that free electron cloud absorbed and scatter light and they solved it putting two electrodes on either side of the waweguide
