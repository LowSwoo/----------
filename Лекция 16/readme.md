The aritcle under consideration is entitled "Aerial Stealth.Plasma antennas disappear when shut off". The Author of the text is Steven Ashley, Scientific Amaerican by 2014. 

The paper devoted to plasma antenna technology. This innovation is based on high ionized gases in sealed tubes. This gase gase can readily radiate, absorb or reflect electromagnetic waves. Altering the plasma density we can change radiofrequences it broadcasts and picks up. 

The main Advantage of the antenna is that it becomes invisible when deactivated (switched off). Thus this techology can be used to shield satellite te electronics from jamming signals or it connect  can act as directional reciever. 

Summing the text up research was canceled due to technical difficulties (scienties could not stear the beams in two directions). 

This text can be usefull to radio-engineers.

This text about radiology diagnostic. It use the x ray examination. 

The x ray passes through the patient ant it captured the image. The value of these images helps doctors understand what is wrong with patient. 

Different body parts requires different effective doses. An example ches require about 0.1mSv. 

Examination of the lower bowel requires injection barium enema substantial and this effective dose is zabout 6mSv
